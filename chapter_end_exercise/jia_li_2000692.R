# P-value(85.01%) far larger than our significance level, we cannot reject null hypothesis
# In netherlands, online prices are smaller or equal to offline prices

# Test 3: The online prices in NL are larger or equal to offline prices

#   HA: price_online - price <  0
# # we set the significance level as 1%

#P-value(14.99) far larger than our significance level of 1%, we can not reject the null hypothesis
# The online prices in NL are larger or equal to offline prices

## From three tests, we conclude that there is no price difference between online and off-line prices in Netherlands.
## Compared with case study, we arrived at the same conclusion.
